* Untar *MST.tar.gz* and enter the folder *MST*.
* Run *MST.ipypy* to get velocity coherent manimum spanning trees. Before running, several parameters should be set:
* (1)'my_dL', the maximum distance between two nodes to be connected;
* (2)'my_dV', the maximum velocity difference between two nodes to be connected;
* (3)'filename', the path of your data table. 
* 
* A demo figure that shows the MSTs is generated in the folder *fig*.
